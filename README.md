# DU-Lua-Scripts
A collection of potentially useful scripts and tools for Lua programming in Dual Universe.<br>
Nothing super complicated here, but perhaps you find some of these scripts useful to learn from.<br>

<ul>
<li><b>Conway's Game Of Life</b> - GOL done in lua. Runs on an in-game screen. </li>
<li><b>DU Image To Lua-string Converter</b> - Convert images to string which can be loaded and displayed by a single Screen element.</li>
<li><b>Drawing Board 1.1</b> - Draw images by hand on a screen using custom colors and a minimalistic UI.</li>
<li><b>Matrix Code Rain</b> - Creates a "Matrix"-like scrolling backdrop, using a non-Cyrillic character set.</li>
<li><b>Terminal Stream</b> - Emulates an active terminal, scrolling text with editable technical jargon and color.</li>
<li><b>Test Screen</b> - Renders every character above its ascii code, including "unavailable" chars. General screen debug.</li>
</ul>
