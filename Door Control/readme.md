# Lua Door Access Code Control Script

### MAKE SURE you change the default access code when installing the script

Recommended to have the programming board be triggered by a Detection Zone linked to a switch, so it will start automatically when someone is in proximity of the door/screen.

All colors on the screen are easy to change variables. Users can be assigned specific codes that only work for them, or general all-access codes can be created.
Supports automatic recognition of the system owner by player ID.
