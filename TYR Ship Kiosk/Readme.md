# TYR Ship Sales Kiosk

This script displays all relevent flight-statistics and characteristics for a given construct in a tab-like widget, alongside an image roll of said construct. Use it to display ship models or building blueprints and tokens for sale.
Does NOT have the ability to record orders. This script is Screen-Unit ONLY.

Originally written for TYR Expedition Group, I have been given permission to open source the code and provide it free to anyone who wishes to use it or improve upon it.

You may remove the TYR branding at your discretion, however we ask that if you're going to use our script without significant modification, that you please at least keep the mostly-transparent footer at the bottom intact for our recognition.

	<li>Copy the contents of the renderscript file and paste it into your Screen element, making sure you have LUA selected at the top. Ensure the screen is on.</li>
